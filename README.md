# hello-world
about myself: a Computer Science student with a pasion for games and the way they are created, i also like to thinker and modifi the devices i use to explore the potencia, and even expand it's usability.

Things i like to tell myself:
"Not been ready is not an excuse to not do"
"And not knowing something is the firt step to learn"
